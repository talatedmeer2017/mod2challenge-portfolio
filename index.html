          </h2>
          <p>
            A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model.
            The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET, Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, 
            and http for communications between client and server. 
            
            A web developer may specialize in client-side applications, server-side applications, or both.

          <p>
            Portfolio is partly based on the Latin folium, meaning "leaf, sheet".
            A portfolio usually represents a portable showcase of your talents. 
            Today actual portfolios are used less than they used to be by artists, 
            since most commercial artists have a website dedicated to showing off their art. 
            
            But portfolio in its other common meaning is extremely common. 
            Not so long ago, a broker would keep each of his or her clients' investments in a separate notebook or portfolio. 
            
            Today the investment portfolio, like an artist's portfolio, usually takes the form of a Web page, 
            even though everyone still uses the same old word.

          <p>
            A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete,
            often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent
            post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,
            occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. 
            
            In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited.
            MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an
            increasing quantity of blog traffic. 
            
            The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media.
            Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.
